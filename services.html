</span><p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>The name
and origin of the virus</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">The name
of the virus has rapidly evolved since the first cases in early December 2019
and the recognition that it was a new virus in late December. RNA viruses have
been traditionally named after their location of discovery, so the initial
designation was Wuhan coronavirus. However, no-one wants it named after their
place, so now the agreed on naming of the disease is COVID-19 (COronavirus
VIrus Disease-2019) and the virus is coronavirus SARS-CoV-2. The sequence of
the virus was released in January and made it clear that this virus is from a
bat and related to SARS and MERS, but more closely to SARS; thus, SARS is part
of the name. The other bat coronaviruses came to humans via another mammal
(civet for SARS and camel for MERS) and that is also suspected for the new
virus. The sequence also means that the conspiracy hypothesis about this being
a lab-adapted virus are false. It also means that fish or snakes cannot be the
intermediate hosts.</span></p>



<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-1" style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;"><strong>About
the COVID-19 illness </strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>How
likely is it that the virus will reach Kenya?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">As is
commonly said, microbes don’t need visas. Despite the travel restrictions, the
coronavirus has spread to multiple continents, so it unlikely that travel
restrictions will prevent the infection from coming to other parts of the
world. In view of the degree of secondary transmission in a number of countries
outside China, the major question now is when rather than whether.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>What are
the symptoms of COVID-19?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">The two
main symptoms of COVID-19 are fever and cough. The initial case definition also
included shortness of breath, but that is true only for those who are more
seriously ill. Runny nose and sore throat are very uncommon, so their presence
suggests a different virus.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>How does
SARS CoV-2 (COVID-19) spread?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">SARS
CoV-2 spreads through droplets which are released when people sneeze or cough.
These droplets can only travel up to one meter and cause infection they contact
the mucous membranes of the mouth, nose or eyes. Spread from contaminated
surfaces may also occur, but plays a lesser role.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>Why
doesn’t a mask work for protection?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">The
virus leaves the other person in the form of respiratory droplets. They cause
infection when they land on mucous membranes (mouth, eyes). They may land
directly there or they may do it indirectly. That could be from those droplets
getting on the infected person’s hand; he then touches you and you touch your
mouth or eyes. Or he may cough on you and then you rub your eyes. Or it may be
droplets that land on a counter next to you and then you touch it and then your
face. The virus doesn’t survive a long time on an inanimate object.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">The
above means that the only thing the mask prevents is the virus coming in a
droplet and landing on your mouth. It may make a bit of difference but there
are so many exposures it doesn’t prevent that overall it isn’t worth using for
routine purposes. For people taking care of COVID-19 patients, they wear a
surgical mask and if doing high risk procedures, they wear an N95.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>How long
is the incubation period for COVID-19?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">Incubation
period is the time between catching the virus and when the symptoms of the
disease start appearing. The average is about 5 days and ranges from 2 to 12
days in most cases. </span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>How do I
know if I have COVID-19 and not regular cold or flu?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">The only
way to know if you suffer from COVID-19 is through a special lab test called
PCR. The PCR test is currently available through the Ministry of Health and
soon it will be done at AKUHN. However, COVID-19, being a lower respiratory
illness does not typically have runny nose or sore throat.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>Can
COVID-19 be treated with antibiotics?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">No.
COVID-19 is caused by a virus and antibiotics only work on bacterial
infections.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>Is there
any specific treatment for COVID-19?</strong></span></p>

<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">There is
no treatment for COVID-19 yet. The disease is treated symptomatically, which
means the symptoms (such as fever and cough) are treated rather than the
disease itself.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>How
serious is COVID-19?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">COVID-19
is usually a mild to moderate respiratory (lung) infection. In the elderly or
those who are immunocompromised or have other chronic diseases, it may lead to
a severe pneumonia and can be fatal. Children and young adults rarely develop
serious disease. </span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>What are
the mortality rates?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">So far,
the mortality rates in China have been 2-3% but the true number may be higher
or lower and will certainly depend on the level of care provided by the
hospital. The mortality was higher in Wuhan than other places, possibly because
the health system there was overwhelmed. Most of the people hospitalized in
China have been over 40 (including none under 15) and half have had other
medical illnesses such as diabetes, heart disease or stroke, making them more
vulnerable. So far, 1.5% of those outside China have died. In fact, within
China, the mortality has dropped to 0.7%.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>What is
the risk for health care workers?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">There is
definitely a risk but the magnitude of the risk is lower than initially
thought. In China, the majority of HCW cases were actually acquired within
their own households.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>How are
COVID-19 cases being transmitted in countries with many cases?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">In
China, about 80% of cases have been acquired through household contact and
nearly all the others by close contacts of other types.</span></p>

<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-1" style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Personal
prevention and treatment</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>Is there
anything I should do before it arrives?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">The
short answer is to do common sense things that will keep you in good health.
People are frequently changing their diets, buying respiratory masks, etc. None
of these things will help at this time. </span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>How can
I reduce the risk of getting coronavirus from infected humans?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">It is
likely that the transmission of coronavirus is similar to that of other
respiratory viruses such as influenza. That means that the infection occurs
from contact with respiratory secretions of someone who is infected. That can
be from directly touching the infected person or from being coughed on. Then,
the droplets from the person coughing land on you and establish infection. That
means that the most important thing you can do is proper hand hygiene, either
washing with soap and water or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer when you
have contact with someone who might have a respiratory illness. It is very
unlikely that walking around with a mask (as many are doing elsewhere) will
make any difference.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>Will a
normal flu shot help me avoid the worst symptoms?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">The flu
shot is for preventing infection from influenza and will not prevent
coronavirus infection. However, the illness caused by influenza is similar to
the coronavirus infection, so if influenza is prevented, there is less chance
of suspecting that you have the coronavirus when in fact, it is influenza.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>If I
catch the virus what is the standard treatment?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">So far,
there is not a specific medication that treats the virus (as is true for most
viruses). However, with good supportive care nearly everyone can survive. That
includes oxygen when needed and even a ventilator for those who are really
sick.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>I have a
bad cough and would normally not see a doctor for it—but with this going on,
should I go?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">As of
the 9th of March, we have not had any cases of the coronavirus infection in
Kenya. That means that for people without recent international travel, any
cough is from another cause, usually a virus. If you are not sick enough to
require medical attention, there are two advantages to not going in. First, by
staying at home, you will spread the virus to fewer people. Second, it is
common that doctors give antibiotics even when they won’t help, such as for a
viral respiratory infection, so you can save yourself from an unnecessary
antibiotic.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>Given
that the virus originated from animals should I stay away from meat and animal
products? Should I worry how I handle animals?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">The
2019-nCoV coronavirus is originally a bat virus but likely was initially
transmitted to humans via another mammal. However, now all the transmission is
human to human, so animal contact will not make any difference for this virus.
However, do note that there are other infections that can be acquired from
animals. For example, there is anthrax from dead cattle who are then butchered.
There is brucellosis from goats, sheep and other animals, and Salmonella from
chickens and eggs. And don’t forget dogs; if they haven’t been immunized, they
can transmit rabies when they bite. That means we must be careful with animals,
but it won’t affect our getting the coronavirus.</span></p>



<p><span class="ms-rteForeColor-1" style="font-family: helvetica; font-size: 16px;"><strong>Aga Khan
University Hospital Nairobi preparation</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>What is
Aga Khan University hospital doing for preparation?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">If
patients come with a potentially contagious illness they will be screened on
entry to the facility and when necessary, appropriate precautions will be used.
This includes things ranging from TB to cholera to influenza. That sam​e
screening process will identify people who might have the coronavirus. In that
case, they will be given a surgical mask and will be taken to an individual
room to keep them from placing others at risk. If they require hospitalization,
whether a regular room or intensive care, they will be placed in an individual
room with proper ventilation. </span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>What
level of care will COVID-19 patients receive?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">Patients
with COVID-19 will receive the level of care that is required for their
illness, including intensive care treatment and advanced medical treatment when
needed, such as a breathing mechanical ventilation or kidney dialysis.</span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;"><strong>Where
should a patient with suspected COVID-19 go?</strong></span></p>



<p><span style="color: black; font-family: helvetica;">First,
those do not truly require medical attention should stay home. Those who do
need medical attention should come to A&amp;E where they will be triaged to
room 18 for evaluation. The team there will evaluate the patient quickly and
decide between discharge, admission to ward level (third floor), HDU or ICU. We
anticipate that with the physical exam and pulse ox, the disposition can be
done for most patients. Some may require blood gases or chest x-ray; these are
also available in A&amp;E.</span></p><span style="font-family: helvetica;">
